> **Status:** REVIEW COMPLETE
> **Subject:** `Litema_ The Living Art of the Basotho.md` (Manuscript)
> **Reference:** `Litema_ The Living Art of the Basotho (1).md` (Concept Brief)

## 1. Structural Alignment
The Manuscript accurately executes the "Coffee Table Book" brief defined in the Concept.

| Concept (Brief) | Manuscript (Execution) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chapter 1** | *The Language of Earth* (Intro to significance) | ✅ MATCH |
| **Chapter 2** | *Roots in the Earth* (Historical context) | ✅ MATCH |
| **Chapter 3** | *Sacred Geometry* (Symbols & Meaning) | ✅ MATCH |
| **Chapter 4** | *Hands That Create* (Process & Technic) | ✅ MATCH |
| **Chapter 5** | *Living Tradition* (Modern revival) | ✅ MATCH |
| **Chapter 6** | *Future Patterns* (Challenges/Ops) | ✅ MATCH |

## 2. Reference Cross-Check (Biblio-Forensics)
The bibliography provided in the Manuscript is **High Confidence**. The references cite known authoritative works on Basotho culture:

*   **Primary Source:** *African Painted Houses* by Gary van Wyk (1998). This is the seminal text on Litema.
*   **Historical:** Eugene Casallis (*The Basutos*, 1861). Casallis was a real French missionary who provided early written records of Lesotho.
*   **Modern Art:** Baba Tjeko is a real, active contemporary artist known for Litema-style graphic art.

## 3. The Delta (Interrogation)
*   **Observation:** The manuscript text is highly detailed (academic tone) compared to the "60% Visual" constraint of the brief.
*   **Design Implication:** A strict text-dump will violate the "Coffee Table" aesthetic.
*   **Action Required:** The Digital Flipbook **MUST** enforce the "Swiss Style" by treating this text as a design element. We cannot simply paste walls of text. The `FlipBook` component must layout text in columns with ample negative space to honor the `DES-001` protocol.

## 4. Conclusion
The content is valid and high-quality. Proceed to **Execution Phase** with strict adherence to layout controls.
