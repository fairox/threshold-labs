## 1. Top Signals (External)
*   **Signal A (Spatial Computing):** "Split Perception" — The industry is moving towards architectures where the "AR/World Perception" software stack runs partly on-device and partly in the cloud. This suggests a hybrid future for digital artifacts.
*   **Signal B (Generative):** Continued focus on algorithmic generation of complex patterns (matching the Litema logic).

## 2. Lab Context (Internal)
*   **Asset:** `Litema: The Living Art of the Basotho` (Manuscript & Concept).
*   **Asset:** `Sustainable Ecological Village` (PDF).
*   **Current Work:** We have just deployed the `Litema Flipbook` web app.

## 3. The Interrogation (Delta Analysis)
*   **Conflict:** The Litema project is currently "Static" (a book flipbook) inside a "Dynamic" web app. The external signal suggests *active* perception.
*   **Opportunity:** The "Split Perception" trend validates our decision to make the Litema book *interactive* rather than a PDF download. However, we are under-utilizing the "Generative" aspect. Litema *is* algorithmic (fractal logic).
*   **Critique:** Our current flipbook is a "skeuomorphic" digital twin of a physical book. It does not yet "generate" new patterns, which would be the true bridge to the *Generative Design* signal.

## 4. Hypothesis & Recommendation
**Hypothesis:** To truly align with the "Living Art" title and modern Generative Design trends, the application should eventually include a **Litema Pattern Generator**—a tool that allows users to *create* ("ho lema") their own patterns using the "Sacred Geometry" rules defined in Chapter 3.

**Recommended Lab Action:**
1.  **Short Term:** Maintain the Flipbook as the specific archive (The "Root").
2.  **Long Term:** Propagate a new directive to build a **Generative Litema Canvas** (The "Future Pattern").
