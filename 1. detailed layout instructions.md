# Layout Instructions: Litema: The Living Art of the Basotho

## General Philosophy
The book must feel like an architectural monograph. Use a **12-column modular grid** throughout to echo the geometric precision of the Litema patterns.

## Front Matter
- **Foreword:** Use a "minimalist breathing" layout (Reference: Image 10). Wide outer margins (30% of page width). Text should be set in a clean Serif font for readability, but headers must be bold Sans-Serif.
- **Table of Contents:** Use the grid-cell approach (Reference: Image 5). Each chapter gets a numbered square (01, 02, etc.) with a thumbnail crop of a pattern.

## Chapter Spreads (The "Impact" Pages)
- **Title Pages:** Massive typography. The chapter number should be oversized (Reference: Image 12). 
- **The "Le Corbusier" Grid:** Integrate image captions directly into the grid lines using vertical and horizontal rules (Reference: Image 1).
- **Text Blocks:** Do not center-justify. Use ragged-right alignment to maintain a modern, airy feel.

## Image Treatment
- **Full Bleeds:** Use for panoramic village views to establish scale.
- **In-Grid Clusters:** For "Hands That Create," use a 4-cell modular layout (Reference: Image 4) to show the step-by-step process of mixing clay.
- **Overlay:** Occasionally overlay white geometric Litema line-art over high-contrast black and white photography.

## Specialized Layouts
- **Chapter 3 (Sacred Geometry):** Use the "Typographic Hierarchy" style (Reference: Image 9). List Sesotho pattern names in varying weights from Thin to Heavy.
- **Glossary/Index:** Use the "Brand Guidelines" format (Reference: Image 7). Clear dividers, bold labels, and a secondary accent color (Ochre Red) for the letters A, B, C.
