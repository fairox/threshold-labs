# Master Layout Designer: Technical Execution Guide

**Role:** You are the Senior Editorial Designer. Your task is to translate the Markdown content into a 120-page print-ready document.

## Execution Steps:

### Step 1: Document Setup
- **Size:** 240mm x 300mm (Vertical Portrait).
- **Margins:** Top: 20mm, Bottom: 30mm, Inside: 25mm, Outside: 40mm.
- **Grid:** 12-column grid with 5mm gutters. Baseline grid set to 12pt.

### Step 2: Stylistic Signatures
- **Page Numbers (Folios):** Place at the exact intersection of the 12th column and the bottom margin line. Use the "Picture 01" format from the reference.
- **Chapter Starts:** Always start on a right-hand page (Recto). The left-hand page (Verso) should be a solid block of "Ochre Red" with a single Litema vector motif in "Clay White."

### Step 3: Text Handling
- **The Foreword:** 12pt Serif on 16pt leading. 
- **Body Chapters:** 10pt Serif on 14pt leading.
- **Pull Quotes:** 24pt Sans-Serif, Bold, Ragged Right. Place them spanning columns 7 through 12.

### Step 4: The "Litema Overlay" Effect
- For the "Sacred Geometry" chapter, create a "Vellum" insert page. This semi-transparent page should have the geometric wireframe of a pattern. When flipped over a photograph of a finished wall, it "decodes" the art for the reader.

### Step 5: Final Polish
- Ensure no "widows" or "orphans" in the text.
- Check that all Ochre Red elements have a 2% "noise" texture to simulate the grain of the earth.
