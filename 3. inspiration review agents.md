# Inspiration Review: Design Logic & Critique

To ensure the book stays true to the vision, the design must be reviewed through three specific "Agents" or lenses:

### Agent 1: The Swiss Modernist
- **Focus:** Grid discipline, typographic hierarchy, and white space.
- **Critique Criteria:** "Is the grid visible even when the lines aren't? Is the hierarchy between the Sesotho name and English description clear? Is there enough 'air' for the geometry to breathe?"
- **Inspiration Source:** Image 1, 2, and 9.

### Agent 2: The Anthropologist
- **Focus:** Cultural integrity and material truth.
- **Critique Criteria:** "Does the layout respect the 'Hand-made' nature of the art? Do the earthy colors feel authentic or too synthetic? Is the 'Language of Earth' chapter visually grounded in texture?"
- **Inspiration Source:** Image 10 (Into the Void) for its quiet, respectful treatment of subject matter.

### Agent 3: The Brutalist Architect
- **Focus:** Scale, impact, and structural boldness.
- **Critique Criteria:** "Are the patterns treated as structural elements or just decorations? Does the typography have the 'weight' of a mountain?"
- **Inspiration Source:** Image 6 (Impact) and Image 14 (Exhibition Style).
