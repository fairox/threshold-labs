# Directive: Gamified Research Protocol ("System of Play")

## 1. The Ingest (Gathering the Deck)
The first step is to gather raw material.
- **Internal Assets:** Renders, sketches, and notes located in `lab_assets/`.
- **External Signals:** Trends, papers, and tech news (ingested via `fetch_and_normalize.py`).

## 2. Cardification (The Interrogation)
Every asset must be converted into a "Card" with 4 Key Stats (1-100):
1.  **Aesthetic Friction:** How much does this challenge current design norms?
2.  **Technical Heat:** How relevant is the tech/AI stack?
3.  **Spatial Viability:** Can this be built/experienced physically?
4.  **Threshold Alignment:** Does this feel like "Design by Threshold"?

## 3. The Clash (Interrogative Play)
We do not just list ideas; we pit them against each other.
- **External vs. Internal:** Does a new AI paper (External) beat our current render (Internal) in *Technical Heat*?
    - If **External Wins**: It highlights a **Research Gap**.
    - If **Internal Wins**: It is **Manifesto Material**.

## 4. The Manifesto Engine
The "Winning Deck" defines our stance.
- We draft the **Threshold Manifesto** based only on the cards that survive the Clash.

## 5. Exhibition Planning
The cards determine the space.
- **Winners** -> Physical Models / Large Prints.
- **Losers/Raw Signals** -> Virtual Data Streams / VR Nodes.
