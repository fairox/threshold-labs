# Litema Research Findings

## Phase 1: Foundational Knowledge

### Etymology and Definition
- **Litema** (spelled Ditema in South African Sesotho orthography)
- Pronunciation: [ditʼɪːma]
- Singular: **Tema** (Sesotho for "text" or "ploughed land")
- Etymology: Derived from verb stem -lema (infinitive: ho lema "to cultivate")
- Proto-Bantu root: *-dɪ̀m- "to cultivate (esp. with hoe)"
- Symbolic link to cultivation and ploughed lands

### Basic Description
- Form of Sotho mural art composed of decorative and symbolic geometric patterns
- Practiced in Lesotho and neighboring areas of South Africa
- Created by Basotho women on outer walls and inside of homesteads
- Techniques: engraving, painting, relief mouldings, and/or mosaic
- Patterns combed or scratched into wet top layer of fresh clay and dung plaster
- Later painted with earth ochers or manufactured paint

### Design Characteristics
- Multi-stage symmetry patterns
- Arranged in square cells in a grid formation
- Each cell contains same pattern, rotated or mirrored from cell to cell
- Restrained color design, usually only two colors
- Patterns mimic ploughed fields through combed texture
- Refer to plant life and occasionally other natural world aspects
- May reference clan totem animals

### Cultural Significance
- Transient art form - may desiccate, crumble, or wash away in rain
- Applied for special occasions: weddings, religious ceremonies
- Entire village women participate in application
- Symbolically linked to women's roles as cultivators and foragers
- Associated with vegetative fertility

### Historical Context
- Tradition dates back approximately 5 centuries
- Predates globally popularized Ndebele mural painting (19th century)
- Ndebele igwalo tradition said to be synthesis of Northern Sotho ditema and Nguni design traditions

### Early Colonial Records
- 1813: Rev. John Campbell described Batlhaping art with animal representations
- 1820: Campbell described chief "Sinosee's" house with yellow walls, shields, elephants, giraffes
- George Stow published earliest known litema drawings (8 Bakuena designs)
- 1861: French missionary Eugene Casallis called designs "ingenious"
- Modern curvilinear designs may show Victorian/Edwardian influence

### Contemporary Revival
- 1976: Benedict Lira Mothibe at Lesotho National Teachers Training College
- Students copied litema designs for geometry lessons and potato prints
- 1991-1994: Gary van Wyk extensive field research
- Many specific vegetal patterns forgotten by 1990s, subsumed under "blomme" (Afrikaans for "flowers")
- Some patterns still identifiable: marabaraba board game pattern

## Key Sources Accessed
1. Wikipedia - Litema (comprehensive overview)



### Symbolism and Meaning (from Wikipedia)
- Research by Van Wyk and Mathews suggests litema cannot be understood in purely aesthetic terms
- Sesotho murals are a form of religious art, appeals to ancestors for rain
- Murals can be seen as "prayers in paint"
- If ancestors are satisfied, they provide rain that washes away murals, cycle begins anew
- Women symbolically linked to house (metaphor of womb and creation)
- Linked to vegetal realm through traditional roles as cultivators and foragers

#### Color Symbolism
- Red ocher (letsoku) = "blood of the earth" = fertility, menstruation, sacrifice
- White = calm, purity, enlightenment from ancestors
- Black = dark rain clouds delivered by ancestors
- Colors frequently combined in dense, alternating patterns

#### Pattern Meanings
- Flowers and dots = symbols of fertility
- Chevron patterns = water or uneven ground
- Triangles = symbols denoting male and female
- Patterns mimicking plowed fields through combed texture
- "Headband" patterns along roofline

### Contemporary Studies
- CUT study: No practitioners had knowledge of deeper significance beyond aesthetic purposes
- Some artists shared opinions about symbolic meaning possibilities
- Mothers from Lesotho might have been aware of meanings but didn't share during teaching

### Contemporary Context and Challenges
- Traditional litema practice no longer found in most parts of Lesotho
- Designs and practice in danger of being lost as cultural heritage
- Lives have evolved, no longer build houses the traditional way
- Need to preserve art form through contemporary creative works

### Traditional Process (Detailed Description)
- Women decorated homes, mostly on outside walls
- Basotho homes: whole wall or parts hand-plastered with mud
- Overlaid with cow-dung and mud, sometimes with red soil
- Cow-dung used to strengthen mud - walls/floors don't need replastering for long periods
- Litema designs engraved on wall/floor while still wet
- Pride of every woman and girl to have best designs in their homes
- On outer walls: different colored stones used to create mosaic-like litema

### Contemporary Preservation Methods
- Litema motifs in weaving (mohair wall hangings with Basotho home scenery)
- Woven rugs and mats
- Prints on leather for handbags, cushions, etc.
- Tapestry and ceramics
- Contemporary ceramic art using Chinese painting techniques

### Specific Pattern Examples
- **Boliba** = "deep waters" (used on ceramic plate well)
- **Lihlaba** = "mountains" or hills (used on ceramic plate wedge)
- Combined patterns reflect mountains containing/enclosing water
- Represents Lesotho's landscape (mountainous country with abundant water)
- Water referred to as Lesotho's "white gold"
- Lesotho known as "The Mountain Kingdom"

### Design Inspiration Sources
- Environment and daily life
- Interpreted into geometric form, then repetitive patterns
- Can represent: maize, birds, water, mountains
- Hair plaiting patterns used by girls
- One or more patterns used together if they look harmonious
- Abstract but geometric interpretation of real life

### Cultural Significance
- Art knows no boundaries - past and present co-exist harmoniously
- Heritage can live on through incorporation into contemporary works
- Reflects daily life in villages of Lesotho

### Technical Application Details
- Women decorate house after men finish building
- Soft and flowing geometric patterns
- Applied with fingers, forks, and sticks on walls
- Sometimes colored with natural pigments or commercial paint and stains
- Stones embedded in mud and relief designs for permanent effect

### Historical Evolution
- Initially appeared inside dwellings
- Only in 19th century appeared on outside of homes
- Contemporary practice: seasonal phenomenon for special events
- Announces births, deaths, weddings, Christmas, Easter
- Serves as reminder of passage of time

### Social Process
- Before important events, entire village might be decorated
- Chief artist or advisor directed and advised women
- Special occasion became social event
- Most skilled artist would sketch intentions in dust
- Consensus reached on design before work began
- Women squatted and drank tea during planning
- Now: individual women prefer personal designs
- Still opportunity for social get-together with advice and moral support

### Historical Documentation Timeline
- **1812**: John Campbell visited chief Sinosee (Hurutse lineage of Tswana)
- **1880**: George Stow compiled Campbell's accounts
- **1905**: Stow's book "The Native Races of South-Africa" published
- **1861**: Eugene Casallis (French missionary) called designs "ingenious"
- **1976**: Motibe's students collected 29 designs at Lesotho National Teachers' Training College

### Pattern Names and Meanings (from 1976 collection)
- **Lekoko** = animal skin
- **Lithebe** = shields
- **Litepo** = spider web
- **Moseme** = reed mat
- Underlying influence from artists' immediate environment

### Design Influences
- Linear patterns resembling furrows in ploughed fields
- Fields lying empty after harvesting
- Natural forms: leaves, corn seeds, flowers
- Modern influences: Dutch delft articles, magazine pictures, traditional Basotho blankets
- Basotho blankets display Art Nouveau design style (Victorian era)
- Some Litema patterns are exact copies of Basotho blanket patterns

### Seasonal Cycle
- "Like flowers, Litema blooms with arrival of spring and wilts with approach of winter"
- Dies with temporary surface of mud it adorns
- Sun dries and cracks design
- Rains wash away 'dead' design
- Makes way for new decorative opportunities

### Contemporary Threats (1976-2003)
- Mr. Motibe's 1976 fear: disappearing art form
- Urbanization contributing to demise
- Use of concrete and modern paints
- Indigenous form of decoration and art under threat
