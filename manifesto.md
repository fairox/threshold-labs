# The Threshold Manifesto

## 1. The Delta Between Myth & Machine
We stand at the intersection of ancestral logic and computational future. To "Design by Threshold" is to acknowledge that the smartest algorithms were written in the soil centuries ago. Litema is not just pattern; it is code.

## 2. Interrogation Over Production
We do not simply produce. We interrogate. Every render is a question: "Does this advance the human condition, or merely decorate it?" If the answer is decoration, delete the file.

## 3. The Gamification of Truth
Research is not a static PDF. It is a playable dynamic. By reducing complex architectural theory to 'Trump Card' metrics, we force ourselves to be honest about Impact, Resilience, and Velocity. If you cannot quantify your intent, you do not have one.

## 4. The Lab is Everywhere
From the digital voids of the web to the physical plains of Lesotho, the Lab exists where the connection is made. We are not a studio. We are a signal processor.

**Change starts within.**
